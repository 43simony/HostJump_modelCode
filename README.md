# HostJump_modelCode

### About This Project
All resources necessary to replicate results from "Spillover is not a predictor of host jump risk: novelty is". The R script `.\src\hostJump_FullModel.R` provides all necessary functions and code to replicate all model results and figures. Note that it may be necessary to modify the file paths to save figures and run the C++ simulation code in `.src\HJ_simulation.cpp`.

### Repository Structure
```
.
├── figures/
└── src/
    └── simulation_files/
```
- `figures/` contains figures generated by the source code
- `src/` contains source code required to run the model, along with all auxillary functions and dependencies
- `simulation_files/` contains files used and produced by the C++ simulation code


### Getting Started
